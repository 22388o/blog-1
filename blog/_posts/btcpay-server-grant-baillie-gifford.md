Baillie Gifford, an investment management partnership is providing an annual grant over four years to the BTCPay Server Foundation.

Founded in 1908 in Edinburgh, Scotland, Baillie Gifford has US$487bn of assets under management and advice for a global client base. Focused on long-term growth, Baillie Gifford is wholly owned by its partners, all of whom work within the firm.

We would like to thank Baillie Gifford for supporting us and the Bitcoin open-source environment. With this grant, Baillie Gifford became one of our largest supporters, allowing the BTCPay Server contributors to continue working on creating free and open-source payment processor for anybody in the world to use.

This grant will help us further achieve our [roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/btcpayserver/projects/9) goals for this year centered around a visual overhaul of BTCPay Server, mobile app development and the transition from a self-hosted payment processor to a modular Bitcoin payment platform.

Baillie Gifford, welcome to the BTCPay Server family!

We also thank our dedicated and passionate community for their daily support in making BTCPay Server the best Bitcoin merchant solution possible.

_If you're a business that would like to support BTCPay Server contributors please get in touch via the [contact form on the foundation's website](https://foundation.btcpayserver.org/)._

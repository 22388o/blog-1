Today, we're releasing [BTCPay Server Directory](https://directory.btcpayserver.org/). An index of businesses, non-profits organizations and individuals that use BTCPay Server and want to showcase their donation pages, apps, crowdfunding campaigns or projects.

Promoting a Bitcoin business can be challenging. Advertising networks are notorious for censoring and blocking cryptocurrency ads. Merchants reported that their legit ad campaigns were getting shut down by Google, Facebook and even a portion of e-mail providers.

The idea of a Bitcoin directory isn't new. There are plenty of directories out there. Our focus is on showcasing self-sovereign businesses and projects that use our open-source payment processor and helping them get the word out.

BTCPay Server directory is a community effort. The idea was born on our [Telegram Chat](https://t.me/btcpayserver) a few weeks ago. A small team called the "[task force](https://twitter.com/pavlenex/status/1145998464221945858)" volunteered and helped bring the project from idea to reality. We formed a #Directory channel on BTCPay Chat and started working.

As you know, [BTCPay](https://btcpayserver.org/) is free and open-source software that doesn't collect data on the users. The entries included in the directory are gathered from the tweets or our community chats, where community members shared their projects.

## Submitting your entry

If you're using BTCPay and want to be listed, [submit your entry](https://directory.btcpayserver.org/submit/) and we'll add you as soon as possible.

This community project is still a work in progress. If you have any feedback or you have the skills and want to help us improve it, install the [Mattermost](https://mattermost.com/download/) app on your mobile or desktop and join us in [#directory](https://chat.btcpayserver.org/btcpayserver/channels/directory) channel.

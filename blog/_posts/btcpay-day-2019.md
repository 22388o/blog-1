On the 16th of September, we're organizing a **BTCPay Day**. The full-day event will be packed with presentations from well-known community members and workshops for developers, entrepreneurs or just regular Joes who would like to learn something new.

## Early Bird Tickets available

To ensure the quality of interactions and that enough time is dedicated to each attendee, we're limiting the event to only 40 spots. We've attached a symbolic fee to reduce RSVP spam of 5EUR for the first 20 tickets and 10EUR for the remaining tickets. We'll be using the proceeds from the ticket sales towards the event.

You can [book a ticket at day.btcpayserver.org.](https://day.btcpayserver.org) You will be taken to a page where you can make a purchase. **Please make sure to provide a valid e-mail address** on the invoice page since you will be receiving your ticket details there. Due to the limited amount of tickets, please buy a ticket only if you're certain you can and will attend.

This is our first event, and we can't wait to meet all of you there. All of our core contributors and many other active members of the community from all over the world will be attending. This will be a day when we'll finally all meet each other after 2 years of building BTCPay together. See you in Riga!

This event would not be possible without [CryptoCash](https://twitter.com/cryptocash_riga) and [HodlHodl](https://hodlhodl.com/). HodlHodl helped with the event planning and CryptoCash provided us with the amazing office-space free of charge. In their office space, during BTCPay Day, you'll be able to buy and sell Bitcoin, get t-shirts or a hardware wallet. We would like to thank both companies for making BTCPay Day possible.

We're thrilled to announce that the BTCPay Server Foundation has received grant #7 from [OKCoin](https://www.okcoin.com). OKCoin is matching our biggest supporter to date and will be donating a total of 100,000 USD over the next 12 months.

Founded in 2013 and headquartered in San Francisco with offices spanning across the world, **OKCoin** is one of the largest digital assets and virtual currencies exchanges. Their mission is to make it easy and safe to buy and sell crypto assets using local currencies globally.

When we were first introduced to OKCoin, it was clear that they deeply care for open-source and understand its importance for the entire ecosystem. The focus of our conversations was on improving user-education and user-experience of BTCPay Server.

With that in mind, a portion of this grant will be used on funding contributors who improve our documentation, ease of deployment, video materials UI and UX. Another part will go towards the new GreenField API, which will allow enterprises and developers to build on BTCPay Server with greater flexibility.

This is not their first grant of this type. Earlier this year, they provided an individual developer grant to a well-known Bitcoin core developer, [Fabian Jahr](https://blog.okcoin.com/2020/02/10/fabian-jahr-receives-independent-developer-grant/).

We would like to thank [Square Crypto](https://twitter.com/sqcrypto) for introducing us to OKCoin and sharing the documentation that helped us speed up the process.

Thanks to OKCoin's philanthropic gesture, our vision lives. We remain committed to making an open-financial ecosystem for everyone, free, forever.

Thank you for your support OKCoinðŸ’š!

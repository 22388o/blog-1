# Privacy Policy

We protect your privacy by not collecting any data, the rest is on you.

We do not use traffic analytics, ads or any other sort of data collection or tracking.

Please note that certain pages have embedded YouTube video(s). We enable privacy-enhanced mode for the embedded content from a third-party such as YouTube. According to them, they won't track your visits unless you play a video.

We recommend you to use [a privacy-badger](https://www.eff.org/privacybadger) plugin to prevent third-party tracking indefinitely.
